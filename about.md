Prosop is in development. In order to train the tool, we need data (lots of it). If you have large lists of historical individuals that you are willing to share, please contact us. 

Join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/prosop).

The project also welcomes input on the technical side. If you are working on semantic data, social networking, naming, mapping, or other related projects, please be in touch.

Public access is planned. Stay tuned.
