I'm spending the month of November in Leipzig, thanks to a [research visit grant](https://www.daad.org/researchvisit) from the [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/). My host is Professor [Thomas Riechert](http://www.thomas-riechert.de/about/en/thomas-riechert) of the Leipzig University of Applied Sciences ([HTWK Leipzig](https://www.htwk-leipzig.de/en/)). Thomas is one of very few people worldwide to have produced a graph database in the domain of history: the [Catalogus Professorum](http://catalogus-professorum.org/website/page!en?m=http://catalogus-professorum.org/lipsiensis/). He is currently working to link that list of University of Leipzig professors with other historical databases of European university professors, through the [Heloise project](http://heloise.hypotheses.org/).

Leipzig is a hotbed of digital work. I'm spending time learning from two different groups. The [Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web](http://aksw.org/About.html) (AKSW) group is a hive of computer scientists who work in a very different idiom from any I'm used to, and I feel lucky to get to hang around them. The [Humboldt Chair in Digital Humanities](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/) shares a building with AKSW. Its members are mostly classicists, and their work style is more familiar, but also quite exciting.

While I'm here, I'm trying to accomplish a number of things. I'm aiming to post a set of my Prosop data, about persons in turn-of-the-century Alexandria, as a SPARQL endpoint. I'm writing a tutorial about creating small RDF databases for the [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/). Finally, I'm trying to develop a basic schema for Ottoman geo-spatial data that can serve the gazetteer of the [Digital Ottoman](https://www.academia.edu/12907642/The_Digital_Ottoman_Platform_Workshop) project.
